I am a second-year graduate student as well as Computer Science researcher focusing on Artificial General Intelligence, Embodied AI, and Robotics. I am currently working as a research assistant at Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute, advised by [Professor Hang Zhao](https://hangzhaomit.github.io). I am also a member of the [MARS Lab](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn) at ShanghaiTech University, advised by [Professor Soeren Schwertfeger](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/people/soeren). I tightly collaborate with students at Stanford University and Carnegie Mellon University.

In order to reach AGI, my research interest mainly focus on the two aspects of robot learning:

1. **Cognitive Intelligence**: Learn real-world relation model through interacting with the world (self-supervised exploration and learning)

2. **Atheletic Intelligence**: Designing a general learning algorithm that can solve as many robotics control problems as possible. Also co-optimizing the robot hardware and software to achieve better performance. Especially Humanoid and Quadruped robots.

I have participated in several competitions: CMCM, MCM, RoboMaster. I was the project manager in the ShanghaiTech RoboMaster team.
