I am a second-year Grad student as well as Computer Science researcher focusing on Artificial General Intelligence, Embodied AI, and Robotics.

In order to reach AGI, my research interest mainly focus on the two aspects of robot learning:

1. Learn real-world relation model through interacting with the world (self-supervised exploration and learning)

2. Designing a general learning algorithm that can solve as many robotics control problems as possible.

I have participated in several competitions: CMCM, MCM, RoboMaster. I was the project manager in the ShanghaiTech RoboMaster team.
